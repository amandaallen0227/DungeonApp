            "You walk forward through the weak portal at the end of a long cave system. You're immediately met by a foreboding world. The land is burning, literally. Fires wreak havoc to everything that's even remotely alive, which by now is very little. You realize, you are in EDOM. A wave of nostalgia hits you, somehow you feel at home. Even with these rough conditions you're at ease and you feel secure here. This world is indubitably pleasing, you should be perfectly safe as long as you use common sense. Nearby you hear songs and growls of the strangest creatures you could've imagined. Many of them keep their distance from you, you try to avoid getting too close. You can see muscular creatures, scaly creatures, and what you think might be hairy creatures of some sort.",
            //the world of death and the grave: Sheol
            "You move forward through the enticing portal previously locked behind intricate locks and traps. You're immediately met by a gloomy world. With each step you take you slide forward a little more. Ice covers everything, soon it might even cover you. Life here looks nothing like what you're used to, in fact in seems as if there is not life here. As you enter this city you see a sign that says 'SHEOL / the city of death'. This world is clearly treacherous, but with great risks come great rewards. In the nearby proximity you see strange shapes of beings you thought only existed in the minds of dreamers. There's definitely some hostility going on, you keep your guard up just to be safe. ",
            //The land of Uz
            "You cautiously venture forward through the lively portal in this sacred temple. You're immediately met by a foreboding world. Rocks cover virtually every surface you can see, which makes traversing this landscape tricky and dangerous. You could've sworn something touched your leg just now, perhaps to inspect you or to get a taste. This world is no picnic. Not all the creatures seem content with your presence, one begins to come towards you...",
            //Laodicea - a self loving self  protecting land. There a constant need for distraction and comfort
            "You stride forward through a dark forest and you're immediately met by a bustling world. Snowflakes gently glide by, they cover the entire landscape in a thick layer of snow and a silence has taken hold of the air. It feels as if you are in a dream; a sense of relief takes over as you realize this world might be safe to venture into further.",
            //Goshen 
            "You are walking up to a desolate fortress. You're immediately met by a depressing city. The air is thick with smoke, obstructing your vision beyond a few meters. Each step you take is a burden on your very being, this world is clearly not meant for you. Because of these horrible conditions you feel exposed and in jeopardy. Far behind you you smell the pungent odors of creatures. Some have noticed you, and their interest has peaked. ",
            //the land of Nod
            "As you get closer your eyes begin to burn for the light. The land of Nod is ancient and to enter is to experience peace. You find yourself face to face with enormous statues carved out of the mountains themselves. Carvings of beings you've never seen before. This world seems too calm. Whether this is true or just appearances remains to be seen, but for now you're hopeful. Despite the uncomfortable atmosphere you don't feel a sense of dread or danger.",
            //Jerash - tiny but mighty. Overcomers.
            "You have traversed through Jordan and have now entered JERASH. You're immediately met by a hostile world. The air is dry and hot, bright light blinds you and you can feel your lungs burn with every breath. You can't help but wonder who or what inhabits this world and you can't wait to find out. Who knows what secrets this world holds, but not everything that's hidden may be as pleasant as this world.",
